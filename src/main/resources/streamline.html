<h1>StreamLine Brainstorming Rickard and Michael</h1>

<h2>Basic Building Blocks</h2>

<p>
    We use a nodespaces of semistructured data to represent each item contained in the application as a
    changelog of Quadruples (4 Dimensions) of <a href="#person">Person</a>, <a href="#location">Location</a>
    , <a href="#time">Time</a> and <a href="#content">Content</a>.
    This Quadruple is called <strong>Change</strong>.
</p>

<p>
    The number of changes that forms a document or communication is called ChangeLog/Stream/ChangeStream/ChangeTree.
    In its simplest form it contains only a single entry. A linear thread of changes forms a stream. Whereas a realistic
    representation forms a tree originating at the starting root entry and branching off as parallel versions are
    created. If versions are merged again this tree evolves to a graph or network of changes. Each change within a
    stream must be additionally identified by a version number.<br/>
    Each change also has a direct relationship to the node representing the whole stream which also contains the
    properties
    and relationships that are valid (and immutable) for the whole stream.
</p>

<p>
    The person making the change is perhaps not directly connected to the change but rather as
    <strong>contributor</strong>
    containing a link to the person and a second to a role in which the contribution was made. Its also possible that
    multiple persons made a change at the same time. The location of these persons then would also be attached rather
    to the contributor node than to the change node.
</p>

<p>
    The core of the framework is a very fast store for Changes which maintains a HEAD revision. Filtering,
    querying the store for different projections of the stream.
</p>

<p>
    All changes in the system form a cloud in the named four dimensions which can be filtered, queried, projected and
    represented according to the requirements of the usecase. The perspectives and views choosen to represent the
    projected change are also not restricted.
</p>

<p> Using a REST based approach which separates internal models from the
    external representations that are made available to the clients allows a multitude of representations without
    coupling these to the internal handling of the model. So for instance displaying a document as mindmap,
    text-processor document or version history is just a question of the choosen representations.
    Representations could also include highly interactive and visual approaches. See Parallax Freebase for massive
    interactive querying and the Vimeo Code Swarm Visualization for SVN repository histories.
</p>

<p>
    The basic approach should be considered as similar to a distributed source control management system (like git or
    mercurial). For offline work local copies of the repository with all the functionality must be available.
    Individuals
    have the responsibility and possibility of deciding which of their locally stored change-set are published to
    the public stores or other personal stores. Change identification doesn't rely on files and their attributes but
    rather on internal representations (kind of hashes) of the documents edited.
</p>

<p>
    Another idea regarding the processing of changes is the application of tree and graph theory also for applying and
    merging changes. Transforming content and changes into parsed tree representations (AST) allows a much more easy
    merging that with current text only based diff tools. (See refactoring on the AST/PSI in IntelliJ)
    <strong>But even then generating, applying and merging the changes is the main challenge of this kind of
        application.</strong>
</p>

<p>
    Graph based approaches allow us to store semi-structured data. Therefore no two data sets stored in the node
    space must be of equal structure. For keeping type information and other aggregating structures we can use
    specialized
    type nodes which hold connections to all nodes of a certain type. With the relationship based approach to typing
    multiple typing is very easy and attaching additional information on the type itself is also provided.
    Concrete nodes and their types form spheres of interest which can be easily accessed by traversing the nodespace
    either
    inside out from the change or outside in from the type nodes.<br/>
    <br/>
    Graph databases allow us fast retrieval and traversal of large structures. Supporting functionality for searching
    and filtering comes from full text retrieval systems /indexers like lucene.<br/>
    All access to the graph database is fully transactional so that multithreaded access poses no problem.<br/>
    As our data structures will be so simple a tuple space based solution for scaling is also possible (e.g. GigaSpaces,
    Coherence).
</p>

<p>
    The change will rely on an universal id at the center. All other data is added in addional layers. First core state
    and types and then the data, types and behaviour that come with the patterns/principles (implemented by
    concerns and sideeffects of the application domain).

<h3>Basic associated Node Types of a Change</h3>
<a name="person"/>

<h3>Person</h3>
<h4>Attributes</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Name</li>
    <li>Portrait</li>
    <li>openId</li>
    <li>public key</li>
</ul>
<h4>Relationships</h4>
<ul>
    <li>

    </li>
</ul>
<a name="location"/>

<h3>Location</h3>

<p>
    Location is the place where the change was made. Can be derived using GPS, IP-Lookup, WLAN-Lookup, Mobile-Tracing
    whatever.
</p>

<h4>Attributes</h4>
<ul>
    <li>gps coordinates</li>
    <li>address - perhaps rather node than attribute</li>
</ul>
<h4>Relationships</h4>
<ul>
    <li>other nodes regarding locality: city, country, addresses</li>
</ul>
<a name="time"/>

<h3>Time</h3>

<p>
    Time is represented as (second) nodes in the nodespace. Only the time nodes that are actually needed by the changes
    are created.<br/>
</p>
<h4>Time nodes form a node hierarchy.</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Second</li>
    <li>Minute</li>
    <li>Hour</li>
    <li>day of month</li>
    <li>month</li>
    <li>year</li>
    <li>epoch</li>
</ol>
<h4>Attributes</h4>
<ul>
    <li>actual timestamp in gmt</li>
</ul>
<h4>Relationships</h4>
<ul>
    <li>parent time hierarchy nodes</li>
    <li>incoming: nodes that occur at this timestamp</li>
</ul>

<a name="content"/>

<h3>Content</h3>

<p>
    Content is the data that was produced at this timestamp by this person at this location. It is normally
    a part of a larger stream of content (diffs) that form documents or communication.
    The content is stored as a log and at the same time a HEAD revision is maintainted as the current representation
    of the accumulated changes.
</p>
<h4>Immutability and Security</h4>

<p>
    Content is immutable and may be digitally signed (using the public key of the associated person and can be encrypted
    if needed.
</p>
<h4>Attributes</h4>
<ul>
    <li>metadata</li>
    <li>size</li>
    <li>mime type</li>
</ul>
<h4>Relationships</h4>
<ul>
    <li>time</li>
    <li>person</li>
    <li>location</li>
    <li>tag</li>
    <li>document/communication/</li>
</ul>

<h2>Values, Principles and Patterns/Practices</h2>

<p>
    A system of <strong>values</strong> is the basis for every domain. Derived from that are <strong>principles</strong>
    that are the general rules of effective work in this domain. The concrete, applicable <strong>practices and
    patterns</strong> are developed based on these principles in a certain context with individual forces that must be
    balanced to achieve the desired outcome.<br/>
    (Design-)Patterns describe roles and relationships. The same goes for concerns of an application domain (e.g.
    workflow).<br/>
    So what we want to do ist to explore the value system of the targeted application domain and look for existing
    principles and patterns and apply them as concerns and sideeffects to our existing basic framework. Each concern
    might bring along further behaviour and/or data that is added to the basic entities.
    <strong>When concerns change, the data does not go away but rather stays available
        - Model Change does not require instance change</strong>

<h2>Potential Applications</h2>

<h3>Workflow Management - StreamFlow</h3>

<p>Workflow Management is a important issue in governental institutions and companies. Existing
    solutions are not sufficient and much to complex. A simpler and more flexible approach is needed that is able to
    include

<h4>Intented Features</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Immutable Change Log at the core</li>
    <li>Multitude of representations</li>
    <li>Fast retrieval and querying</li>
    <li>Fast handling of merges, projections</li>
    <li>Easy extension with concerns and sideeffects derived from the best working practices of the domain
        <ul>for instance
            <li>Signing, Encryption with PKI</li>
            <li>Roles and role based ACLs</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
<h4>Previous thingking about workflow (partially outdated)</h4>
<h5>what belongs to a task</h5>
<ul>
    <li>Content and its Content-Types</li>
    <li>Task as basic data</li>
    <li>People</li>
    <li>Communication</li>
    <li>Type</li>
    <li>Metadata</li>
    <li>Attributes</li>

</ul>

<h3>Software Development - StreamSource</h3>

<p>We want to use the software as dogfood / bootstrapping application for its own distributed
    development. So that we get annoyed by incomplete, inconsitent, unusable features and will fix them.
